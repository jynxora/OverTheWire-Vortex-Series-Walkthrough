# OverTheWire — Vortex Wargame

A clean, level-by-level documentation of my progress through the Vortex wargame on OverTheWire.

The goal of this repository is to break down each level with clarity:

- What the binary does

- What vulnerability/mechanic it teaches

- My workflow

- Reproducible code/commands

- The final exploit method

This repo will serve as long-term documentation for my #700DaysOfSkill challenge.
